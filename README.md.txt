# Inspirational Career Message ðŸ’¡

This is a simple beginner-friendly Python project that asks for your name and responds with an encouraging, motivational message about career change and perseverance.

## ðŸŒ± About the Project

I created this as my first GitHub project to practise the fundamentals of Python â€” specifically how to:
- Use `input()` to collect user input
- Work with strings and variables
- Output text with `print()`

More importantly, this project reflects a powerful reminder that **it's never too late to change your career**. Life may throw challenges our way, but resilience, bravery, and persistence will always move us forward.

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository or download the `message.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
4. Run the script:

~~~bash
python message.py
~~~

What is your name? Kerry

Hi Kerry,
It's never too late to change your career.
Life has a way of throwing lemons, but you can always make lemonade.
Be brave. Take the jump. Experiment.
Don't get disheartened if you fail â€” keep going and try again.

âœ¨ Remember: every expert was once a beginner. âœ¨
~~~

## ðŸš€ Future Ideas

This project can easily be extended by:
- Adding multiple quotes and randomising the message each time it runs
- Turning it into a simple daily motivation tool that updates automatically
- Creating a version with a graphical interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience
- Building a web-based version where users can get a personalised message online
